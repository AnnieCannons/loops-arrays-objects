# Writing Loops with Arrays and Objects in JavaScript

## Loops with Arrays

- Arrays are ordered collections of elements. You can use loops to iterate through each element in an array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

## Loops with Objects

- Objects are collections of key-value pairs. You can loop through objects in arrays (called collections).

- Loops allow you to perform operations on each element or property of an array or object, making them powerful tools for processing and manipulating data in your JavaScript programs.
